# New user guide

You're new to warframe, or new to the clan, or just possibly a new born baby.

Regardless I'm here for you. You can count on your best pal `Sunny`.

This is a list of guides to help you because, like you, I was once a bouncing Warfame baby.

There are 4 beginning levels to Warframe. These are the levels you're gonna have problems with. Guaranteed. 

* Enemy Levels 0 - 30
* Enemy Levels 30 - 60
* Enemy Levels 60 - 90
* Enemy Levels 100
* ✌️ End game ✌ (those are air quotes)

This is what this wiki hopes to help you with on your journey.
