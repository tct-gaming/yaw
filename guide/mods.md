# Let's talk mods :D
Mods are the way that you modify your weapon to do more damage, proc status effects or other neat-o things. You can even make it reload faster, have more ammo or even make it completely silent!

Before getting into mods we need to understand their mechanics and their acquisition.

# Mod Mechanics
You better believe there are mod mechanics in this game. Basically you get a mod, you rank it up then you apply it to a weapon.

Refer to this mod image for everything below:

![Maiming Strike](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/d/d6/MaimingStrikeMod.png/revision/latest)

## Ranking & Drain
Every mod has dots at the bottom of it. Refer to `Maiming Strike` above. It has 5 blue dots. That means that it is ranked up to it's max (all blue) and that it has a maximum of 5 blue dots.

Filling up a dot is considered "Ranking it up". For every rank you go up with a mod you need to spend a certain amount of endo and credits.

### Drain
Drain refers to the number in the upper right hand corner. Drain is how much capacity a mod will take up.

### Capacity
This refers to how much you can put into either a weapon, frame, archwing, companion and so on. Anything that can accept a mod.

## Polarities
Seeing as you can quickly drain an item of it's capacity if you add a mod to a matching polarity the drain is halved! If you don't match up then it'd **DOUBLED**.

To play around with mods and builds goto [warframe-builder.com](warframe-builder.com) and check out those builds to see more of what I mean. Hands on experience and tinkering will let you understand more than reading it here.

For a specific build check out my [Umbral Saryn](https://tinyurl.com/yyw8qfc7). Note: Don't bother thinking you'll make this any time before finishing the star chart. 

# Types of mods
I don't remember when I stopped getting flawed mods but **DO NOT PUT ENDO INTO THESE**. These are to be tossed out as soon as you get the regular version of it.

## Normie Mods
* Ammo drum
* Vitality
* Continuity
* The armor mod
* others ...

I can't remember them all but you'll be getting a lot of these.

## Aura Mods && Stance Mods
Oh, you want these. And when you get them you **IMMEDIATELY** rank them to max. An aura mod grants you so much more capacity for your warframe and melee weapons

## Exilus Mods
Just grants you one more mod slot but you need an `Exilus Adapter`. Wait on this. as it isn't important in pre-end-game.

## Drift Mods
You get these from Lua and there are a bunch of them. `Power Drift` is excellent. `Speed Drift` is great for speedy frames.

## Nightmare Mods
From a website:

"**Once you "complete" a given planet or moon by fully unlocking all of its mission nodes, you unlock Nightmare Mode missions. These time-limited missions reward exclusive mods with two different stat buffs.**

**For example, Vigor increases both health and shields. And since it isnâ€™t just a Primed version of Redirection (which increases shield capacity) or Vitality (which increases hit points), you can stack those bonuses."**

## Corrupted Mods
Like Nightmare Mods, Corrupted Mods affect two different stats. However, these mods increase one and actually reduce the other

These are some of your more powerful mods. For instance my Saryn build uses 3 of them. `Overextended`, `Transient Fortitude` and `Blind Rage`.

You get these from running the derelict.

## Augment Mods
In my Saryn `Regenerative Molt` is my augment mod. It is a mod that modifies a warframe's abilities. But remember it depends on who you're playing with. If I'm playing with a Wisp or EV Trinity then I might forego this mod and I might have put something else in that position.

## Primed Mods
These are primed versions of existing mods. They are white and they do not drop. You need to buy them from a vender that appears once every two weeks. You'll get a message to tell you they've arrived.

## Riven Mods
Don't worry about these. But also they have crazy stats that make even normally garbage weapons insane. Except the `Stugg`. I hate that weapon.

## Set Mods
Mods that work best in a set. Umbral mods, Augur mods.

## Peculiar Mods
These are just appearance and they are funny. For instance one will grow flowers on bullet hit on an enemy

## ... Conclave
Can't help you here I've never played `Conclave`.

# Some Notes from a Grizzled Vet
* Don't sell your duplicate mods. Dissolve them into endo
* A lot of normie mods the clan is willing to give you
* Transmuting is stupid. Don't do it unless it's for a `Nightwave` challenge.
