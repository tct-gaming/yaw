# Eidolon Hunting

## Introduction
Hi there. I'm Storm and I heard you want to do some Eidolon Hunts.​ ​I'm happy to see you Tenno wanting to join in on the Tricaps, But first lets go over some things you need to get done before you start.

1. You need to complete your War Within quest to have access to your Operator Form.
2. You need access to an Amp that is preferably not the Mote Amp the game supplies you with.

You cannot hope to fight Eidolons without your Operator or a decent Amp and I'll explain why.

## Operator Form
Your Operator form is currently the only way to do Void Damage in Warframe. Void Damage is the only way to take down an Eidolon's Shield. Also, You have access to Void Mode which allows you to be invincible to any attack and is key to dodging some of the Eidolons' abilities.

## Amp
Your Amp is what gives you the primary source of Void Damage. It's your bread and butter tool for slicing through Eidolon Shields or finishing off those pesky Vomvalysts. There are multiple places to secure a nice Amp, But first lets just go to Cetus and talk to Quill Onkko, Who specializes in Amp parts and Arcanes. My best advice for building your first Amp would be to build the X23 Amp. The numbers mean in what order they are available to the Tenno and the 'X' stands for ​`Any Prism​`. However, I feel you should try the 223 Amp as your first.

### The parts you need for the 223 Amp
* Shwaak Prism - Primary Fire
* Shraksun Scaffold - Secondary Fire
* Lohrin Brace - Buff

The 223 Amp will give you the most Critical Chance out of all of the Cetus Amps and is the most reliable, in my opinion. After you've been around the block with tricaps, You'd move onto a X27 Amp, Which is only available from Little Duck at Fortuna with your Solaris rank at max.

## Now about those Eidolons...
Now that you've gotten your Operator operated on and your happy little Amp, We can now talk about Eidolons themselves. I know you must have a lot of questions. What weapons should I bring? What damage should I use? Why do we give them names? What are Eidolon Shields? In this part of the guide I want to focus on types of Damage, Arcanes, Focus Schools, And... GUNS!

## Doing damage
### Eidolon Shield Damage
Okay so, As you've heard me mention Eidolon Shields before, Taking them out is ​CRUCIAL ​to capturing Eidolons. Void Damage is the only way to wreck Shields and this is why I told you to get that new shiny Amp. The rules for damaging Shields are simple:
* Critical Chance is your best friend
* Critical Damage is your second best

Any modifiers that raise your base Critical Chance or Critical Damage will allow you to do extra damage to the Shields with your Amp. This can range from Volt's Electric Shield or to Arcane Virtuos Shadow.

### Eidolon Limb Damage
Limbs are the second part of damage that is needed to take down an Eidolon. The window becomes immediately available right after the Shields are dropped. The different Limbs are their arms, arm-pits, and knee-joints and every one of those parts needs to be taken out. Everytime you eliminate a Limb, The Eidolon will call for help and replenish their shield. Every Eidolon's chassis is made out of an alloy armor meaning Radiation Damage + Critical Chance/Damage builds are the best way to mod your weapons.
