# Loadouts

* How do you like to play?
* Who are you up against?
* What are you trying to do?
* What is your end goal?

Unfortunatly you may not be able to use your favorite frame for all your purposes, but that's fine, you can use your favorite for general gameplay anyway but you'll want to do be more efficient for specific game modes or outcomes. Or because your clan needs you. Will could be often or could be for fun. Either way, don't be a one trick pony.

These all come in to play. In here we have a whole HOST of loadouts (this is the super set to builds)
