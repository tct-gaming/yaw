# Kavats and How to Get Them

This little guide will help you learn how to efficiently farm Kavat DNA. But first, keep in mind that to even start breeding Kavats you will need a `Kavat Incubator Upgrade Segment.`

## Kavat Incubator Upgrade Segment

You can obtain a blueprint for the incubator from the Clan Dojo's Tenno Lab for 15k credits. It's also possible for it to drop from `Hyekka Masters` or to buy a fully built one from the Market for 175p.

In order to build the incubator you will need 100k credits, 1 Argon Crystal, 10 Kavat Genetic Codes, and a whopping 120k Alloy Plates. It's recommended to wait on Kavat breeding until you have passively farmed the Alloy Plates required. However, if you still want to farm them, some of the best places to go are `Gabii` and `Draco` which are both located on the planet Ceres. Best to bring a farming frame if you go this route!

# Kavat DNA Farming

Ahh, Kavat Genetic Codes... One of the most annoying things to farm in the game. If you're one of the lucky few who have not yet completed the `Sands of Inaros` quest, (obtainable from Baro Ki'Teer) you can get a decent amount from the second portion of the quest. 50 Kavats will spawn during it. If possible, have a resource booster active prior to starting the quest to maximize your gains. Keep in mind this is NOT repeatable, as the quest can only be played through once!

## Where and How to Farm

Kavats can be found in any Orokin Derelict mission and will always spawn in pairs of 2 or more. Genetic codes are obtained through scanning feral Kavats. Now, onto the tips!

You will want to bring along a frame that can pacify the Kavats, such as a sleep Equinox, Nova, Ivara, etc,. If you don't have one, try asking a friend or clan member who does to tag along. Next, you or your teammate will need to have the secondary weapon `Ballistica Prime` equipped. This weapon has the ability to create a temporary clone of whatever it kills with its fully charged shot. A Kavat clone can be scanned and provide DNA just like a normal Kavat, so this is extremely useful! Be sure to mod the Ballistica well, Kavats have quite a bit of health.

Steps:
1. Choose either the Exterminate or Capture Derelict mission
1. Search for Kavats
1. Have the Kavats be pacified through sleep or other means
1. Scan the Kavat, then kill it with a charged shot from the `Ballistica Prime`
1. Quickly scan the clone that was created, they don't last long!

Rinse and repeat as needed. 

## A Few More Tips to Keep in Mind

Don't kill everything all willy-nilly! Kavats can and often DO spawn along with large groups of enemies, so exercise caution when farming. Try to have a resource booster and/or resource drop chance booster active, they make a huge difference since Kavat DNA only has a 25.0% chance of dropping. It's also best not to bring any Sentinal or pets along when farming, they often get in the way of scanning or even kill the Kavats if they are strong enough.

If you have the `Synthesis Scanner` available from Cephalon Simaris, be sure to get the following upgrades for it: 
* Sol-Battery Widget
* Cross-Matrix Widget

The Sol-Battery widget gives you infinite scans and the Cross-Matrix widget allows each scan to have a potential to count as two scans. NOTE: If for some reason after several runs you fail to get any DNA using this scanner, switch to your normal one. This could possibly be a bug within the game or just really bad RNG.

And that's it! Good luck on your Kavat DNA farming Tenno!
