# Why does this wiki exist?
We need a wiki to put our cumulative knowledge of Warframe not only for the new players but also for ourselves.

There is a pattern that emerges with every new player.

1. Player joins
1. Player realizes complexity of warframe
1. Player asks questions
1. We answer
1. New player joins
1. Repeat

This isn't a bad thing. That's what we're here for. But instead, because people leave and people aren't always available, it is best to accumilate that knowledge into one source that everyone has access to read and edit. Yes, even a new person is encouraged to add their findings.

There are rules to adding to this wiki. 
1. This is for specialized information
1. Follow the process to add new pages/content to the wiki (coming soon)

I hope this is helpful for you and anyone else!

# What is this wiki?
This is for specialized information that we cultivate over time. It wouldn't be much different than the youtube videos. The difference is that we'd keep ours up to date and we have other information that is useful. But more importantly it's all in one area.

New tenno don't need to search through mutliple videos and veteran tenno don't need to remember which video it was that they wanted. Or the page that they wanted. It's mostly here.

# What isn't this wiki?
This isn't meant to replace the main wiki. This is specialized information. Player builds and play guides. Quality of life guides. This isn't the minutiae of weapon specs at a given level. It is meant to be a quick referance wiki for the TCT Tenno.
