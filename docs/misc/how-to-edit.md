# Contributing
!> **Note** Do not edit on the master `branch`!

## Get Github account
To do any of this you need a github.com account so [register here](https://github.com/join)

## Fork
If you are or want to be a tech person you should learn about `git` but since most of you aren't then understand that you want to fork. We get a better history of what was changed plus changes don't just "show up". It's a way to keep control of the content.

## Where to add content
### Locally
* Install node
* Install a terminal
* Run `npm i docsify-cli -g` in your terminal
* Make your fork by clicking on the `fork` button
* Make a directory somewhere
* Go into that directory
* Clone repo
* Run `docsify serve docs`
* Open your browser
* Goto `http://localhost:30001
* When you edit a file it'll auto reload

?> *Important* There are significant benefits to working locally. Auto reload, seeing where files actually go and all that is excellent :D :D :D 

### Directly on Github
This is more of a PITA since 

?> *Important* Working directly in the web ui is fun but you shouldn't make major changes in it. It's difficult to test that way but for minor corrections or working within the page it's great and fast. Just remember to always `fork`!

## Create a pull request
* Go to https://github.com/tct-gaming/yaw/pulls
* Click `New Pull Request`
* Click `compare across forks`
* On the right hand side click `head repository: tct-gaming/yaw`
* Find your forked repo and select it
  * You should be on master and I don't see why you wouldn't be on there. If you aren't then change the branch
* If all your changes are there then click `Create pull request`
* Explain your changes then click `Create pull request` again
* So long as there are no merge conflicts you're good to go. Notify the admins in discord. We'll merge it if it's good to go.
