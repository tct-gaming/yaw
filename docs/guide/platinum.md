# What is Platinum?
Platinum, or `Plat` is one of the economies of the game. It's the one that you get when you put in actual real dollars. For instance 75 plat is $5 USD. That isn't much as that could be one primed mod that isn't maxed out. A maxed out mod is around 200 or 300 plat. 75 plat could get you two primed weapons. Warframe has 65 warframes that you can get often each is around 200 plat. The game also has close to 300 weapons plus variants. That's an insane number of weapons.

You can see how you can quickly spend multiple paychecks in this game if you planed to `Pay 2 Win`. It doesn't make sense especially since you can get everything for free. 

More importantly you can earn plat in game by doing multiple things.

# Earning Platinum
We are often asked how one earns platinum. It's actually very easy and straight forward. The main price you pay is your time.

# Trading
Trading is the primary way to get plat. Any other way you're asking to get scammed.

## In clan
Always ask the clan first. We don't have a dedicated trading channel yet but when we get bigger it's likely. So ask in `#concourse` first. The clan will be more forgiving with trades especially when the item is easier to get. Something like, say, [`Maiming Strike`](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Maiming_Strike) someone will trade you but you will have to pay.

## Trade Chat
Use your filters, be patient, haggle but never pay more than you should. Some prices are insane.

## Warframe Market
The lazy but [most often] cheapest way to get most items.
