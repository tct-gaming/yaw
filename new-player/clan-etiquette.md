# TCT Clan Etiquette

> Are you looking for a community based on community spirit? Are you tired of elitism, rage-quitting and impossible expectations? Are you fed up with gimmicks and overacting for the sake of attention?
> 
> We have the place for YOU!
> 
> TCTGaming is a beacon amidst the latest trends, founded on values that may be long-forgotten elsewhere. If you are a gamer, new or old, who believes in the values of community, friendship and family, WE WANT YOU!

You signed up because of our simple manifesto. You stay because we're a family and we look at you as one as well.

Every game handles user interaction and community differently and Warframe is no different. So to append to the above rules we also have some extra norms that we all live by.

---

## Discord
Well, you already know that we require you to be in the discord before we send an invite. If you leave discord or the game that's an automatic boot and keeps things fair. 

Now, one of the side benefits that we receive from this is better communication and community. It just works better all around if we do it this way. 

## I promise, we're friendly
If you want to play with us then play with us! Don't be shy!

This is sometimes difficult, I understand, and sometimes we're already busy doing something.

We will notice if you've asked for help or someone to play with in the discord or in-game chat (if we're already in there) and you haven't received takers. So we'll make sure you get the help you need. 

Remember, you can always message us directly if you feel like you're being left out.

## Don't e-beg
We have tenno that are MR3 to MR27. Some of us have it all some of us have very little. We are **ALL** willing to help and give away free mods and blueprints. But only if we can. What is annoying, tho, is when we see someone asking for items (for free) and either

A. Not contributing to the clan in one form or another <br />
B. Not contributing to the discord <br />
C. Just asking for free items <br />

We want to help those that have contributed in one way or another. You'll more than likely get help from those if you are going to be active somewhere in our community. Play a part and we'll hang with you.

## Don't use slurs
While you can be edgy, to an extent, we will not allow hateful speech, slurs or anything of the like. We have people from all walks and you don't know who or what anyone has experienced. While we'll try to be as forgiving as possible multiple instances of the same "infraction" won't be tolerated. 

Feel free to tease or be lightly edgy in discord but remember. You don't know if someone is transgender, of a certain creed, some heritage or nationality or someone's sexual preferences. Keep it cool daddio.

All that being said we can't stop how you talk to people via voice but one can report being uncomfortable if you do.
