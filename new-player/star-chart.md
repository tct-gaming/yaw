# Complete the Star Chart!
Hands down the most important thing that you need to do in this game when you're starting out.

If you haven't cleared the star chart you're very very limited as to the content that you can do.

Also, honestly, people are more willing to help those that have already helped themselves. If you're consistantly in either chats asking for taxis, plat or items people are going to catch on and stop helping or ignoring.

# Why
I'm not going to get into the `pros` because the cons are enough. Flip them and you get the `pros`. Simple enough.

## Cons
### More expensive
If we understand that plat is money that we earn and that things are over priced in the game market then we understand that patience is key to this game then it's more expensive to not finish the starchart. How is that you ask?

Otherwise your options are to buy
* Warframes
* Buy weapons
* Buy fully maxed mods
* Fully maxed archanes
* Primes weapons
* Prime warframes

### Earning plat
1. You earn plat from opening relics.
1. Fissues happen on planet nodes.
1. If you can't open that node you're kinda screwed.
1. You earn less plat.
1. You can trade less.

### Limited access to missions
* Sorties
* Fissures
* Alerts
* Missions
* Invasions

Not having access to the nodes that have been completed limits you to what you can farm. Say you want to build a certain warframe but the resource is on a planet you haven't even gotten to. Now you've just made it more difficult for yourself. 

Your clanmates are willing to help you farm for things that are mutually benefical. Farming for the clan, dojo decorations, themselves as well. If you ask to get 

### Proper endo farming
Endo is required to rank up mods. Some mods have upwards of 10 nodes on them requiring `40,920`! Your options to get endo in the early game are to
* Sell socketed statues
* Sell mod dupes
* Pick up endo in mission

But there are two major ways to do endo farming in the "end game". The first requires you to get to the end of the star chart the second, and much better one, requires you to have completed every node in the star chart. No one wants to do the first method.

Also, I promise you that the game becomes so much more fun when you've maxed things out for your unique god-like builds. If my Saryn build has anything to say about it that is.

### Warframes
If the SC hasnt' been completed there are warframes

Building some of the cooler warframes. Nidus for instance you get after finishing a quest and on Eris. One of everyone's favorites is Saryn and you can only get her from one of the nodes on Sedna and it's an assassination.

Or you can buy them but why waste plat on

### Sundries
Lesser reasons but still important to bring up.

#### Efficancy
Nightmare missions happen on planet nodes. Some of the better mods are on 

#### Trading
The amount of trades you can do per day is tied to your MR. Completing the SC is up to 3 MR levels.

#### 60/60 Mods
While vets are often in the derelict you'll want to be able to help. Being able to help doesn't just mean a good build but rather building keys. 

# So finish the damned star chart
People will only help those that help themselves in a mutually benefical manner. We don't want you to play solo but we also don't want to taxi you through everything. It's also so slow asking for a taxi for everything, don't you think?
