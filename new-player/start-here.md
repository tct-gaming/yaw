# TCTGaming New Recruit Warframe Guide
You're new to TCT Gaming? AND you're new to Warframe? AND you dunno what to do? Where to go? How to get that sick build? Well, let me help you out a bit.

# First thing's first
Complete Star Chart & Main Quests.

## [Complete the star chart](new-player/star-chart)
Just finish the star chart. Seriously, just finish it. We will taxi for certain things but you need to learn the mission and you'll be put in pubs so nothing will be too hard. Shouldn't take you longer than a few of weeks of lazy playing. I'd recommend bothering with story missions after the star chart (that aren't junction requirements).

If any node (not junction) is giving you problems then we can taxi you through it.

But if you don't clear the star chart there is so much you won't be able to do.

* Sorties, fissures, alerts, missions or invasions et al that take place on nodes that you haven't cleared.
* Proper endo farming
* Building some of the cooler warframes. Nidus for instance you get after finishing a quest and on Eris

## Finish your quests
You want to finish up until `The War Within` for the main storyline quests. Everything else is for a warframe, basically, but they are all worth doing and are all actually really fun.

## Also
* Don't bother with fashion frame.
* Unless you buy plat don't spend it on anything other than weapon or warframe slots.
* Don't worry about companions right now.
* Please ignore the open worlds. You aren't ready and you'll make it difficult for yourself and if you get into a squad with an asshole they are going to make you feel like shit. But mostly the OW is really for higher levels that know what is going on already.

## Goto the Dojo and get ... Stuff
There are 4 labs you care about all the time and 1 that you care about once.

I can't remember where exactly it is but find the orokin lab and buy the blueprints for the dragon keys. You'll need them. If you have the resources required then make a bunch of exterminate and capture, 10 each maybe? Then make like 3 of the rest just so that you've completed those missions. You won't need these for a bit while you finish the star chart.

3 Warframes are in the Tenno labs. The rest is mostly weapons that you'll care about but there are 3 blueprints you should buy a bunch of. I bought 90 of each over the course of my play. You most likely don't have the cash for it now but when you make money come over and get more of these BPs. 
* Mutagen Mass (if you see an invasion with this as a reward DO IT)
* Detonite Injector
* Fieldron

# Plat
This is real-world money. If you've used it already that sucks. You can always buy or earn more. If you haven't then please don't spend it on anything other than slots for more warframes or weapons. A good rule of thumb is to spend plat you buy yourself on slots and plat you earn on fashion frame. Try not to spend money on buying frames. I promise you "You don't need it right now". You won't know what to do with it yet or if you even like it.

# Mods & How they work
![](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/2/26/Newmodinfo.png/revision/latest?cb=20140828044554) <br />
Mods are how you change the stats on a weapon and make them play in many different useful or wacky ways. You can have a Guandao that procs corrosive from a mile away or a pistol that does one million damage.

## Capacity
Frame, weapon or companion capacity is determined by a few factors and you can change them in a couple of ways.

First you should know that capacity is the amount of mods you can have on your item. Adding a mod "drains" the capacity of the amount a mod's value contains. The higher the rank the higher the drain. The rank is shown at the bottom of the mod card (blue dots). You use endo and credits (or legendary core but don't use that until you've asked your clan).

You can rank your mods by going to your mod station (next to the pet station).

## Polarities
Don't forget if you match the polarity of your mod to the polarity of the slot you take have (or next one up if it's .5) of the rank of the mod. If it doesn't match you use up more but not really that much more. Okay, that settles mods.

## Potatoes! Auras!!
As for the amount your item has is 30 for a fully ranked item. You can double that by spending a "potato". That's an Orokin Reactor or Catalyst. Gold is for Warframes and companions and silver for everything else.

To add even more to your warframe you do this by adding a mod to your Aura slot (top left). If you match the aura slot you get double what that mod's value is (opposite of everything else). So if you have 7 you get 14 more mod capacity. If that aura mod is 9 (only Steel Charge) you get 18. Pretty sick if you ask me.

## Formas
Lastly formas (the puzzle piece) comes into play with allowing you to change the polarity of a slot. That includes ADDING a polarity. The only issue is that it brings your item back to 0 and you have to re-rank them. Hydron for weapons, SO for WF and companions.

# Affinity
## Affinity Range
![The 3 circles](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8llQ7.png) <br />
Affinity is shared beteen yourself and other players if they are within the affinity range. The 3 circles in the above image

* Affinity is your experiance points. Something cool when you look at your gained experiance in game (look at mission results).
  - When Blue is your experiance that you get and you keep. It's your "base" affinity.
  - Yellow is your extra affinity. This you can lose. 

# Abilities
What your warframe is used for. When we say your `1` or your `4` we mean which ability. `1` is the first ability you unlock when ranking a warframe. On PS4 that is the `X` button. 

* `1` → `X`
* `2` → `□`
* `3` → `◯`
* `4` → `△`

# Credits
You'll get this in normal play but what you'll really want is `The Index`. I can take you there whenever and we'll make you a buttload of cash. **AFTER YOU'VE COMPLETED THE STAR CHART**.

# Future
You'll want to learn about Focus, eidolon hunts, profit taker (no idea still honestly)

# Builds
Hey, we need to share builds. Let's make that easier for each other. Either take a pic of your screen with your phone and post it to discord (yuckers) or instead set up your PS4 to share to your Facebook account. Whenever you share do it so only you use it (first dropdown) then save that picture on your phone or desktop and share it within our Discord. That'll help us help you.
