# TCT Clan Etiquette

> Are you looking for a community based on community spirit? Are you tired of elitism, rage-quitting and impossible expectations? Are you fed up with gimmicks and overacting for the sake of attention?
> 
> We have the place for YOU!
> 
> TCTGaming is a beacon amidst the latest trends, founded on values that may be long-forgotten elsewhere. If you are a gamer, new or old, who believes in the values of community, friendship and family, WE WANT YOU!

You signed up because of our simple manifesto. You stay because we're a family and we look at you as one as well.

Every game handles user interaction and community differently and Warframe is no different. So to append to the above rules we also have some extra norms that we all live by.

## Discord
If you leave discord or the game that's an automatic boot and keeps things fair. 

## Code of Conduct
Toxicity will not be tolerated. This comes in many forms:

- Slurs.
- Attacking (even if friendly) other TCT Tenno.
- Anger with anyone here regardless of rank.
- Pornography.
- Harassing other Tenno in-game.

### Handouts etc

Our number one rule: **Do not go into `#trade chat` expecting free stuff**. This seems harsh and we understand that but we've had issues with this before and it's best to be forthright and upfront with whomever wants to represent TCT. We are, of course, super excited to help so don't feel afraid to ask for that one thing you're missing. 

We want to help those that have contributed in one way or another. You'll more than likely get help from those if you are going to be active somewhere in our community. Play a part and we'll hang with you.

When talking in `#trade chat` there are a couple of rules you should abide by.

1. Do not expect/demand handouts.
2. Do not expect prime sets.
3. Do not expect discounted items.
4. We will give away essential mods.

Excessive begging makes others unhappy or uncomfortable and will result one's membership excised.

### Mods

1. We will not be giving away mods that are worth more than 10 plat.
2. Mods that can be farmed will not be given away but we will teach you how to get them. This only benefits you.
3. For Syndicate mods most of us will give them away for free.

## Don't e-beg
We have tenno that are MR3 to MR27. Some of us have it all some of us have very little. We are **ALL** willing to help and give away free mods and blueprints. But only if we can. What is annoying, tho, is when we see someone asking for items (for free) and either

A. Not contributing to the clan in one form or another <br />
B. Not contributing to the discord <br />
C. Just asking for free items <br />

We want to help those that have contributed in one way or another. You'll more than likely get help from those if you are going to be active somewhere in our community. Play a part and we'll hang with you.

## Don't use slurs
While you can be edgy, to an extent, we will not allow hateful speech, slurs or anything of the like. We have people from all walks and you don't know who or what anyone has experienced. While we'll try to be as forgiving as possible multiple instances of the same "infraction" won't be tolerated. 

Feel free to tease or be lightly edgy in discord but remember you don't know if someone is transgender, of a certain creed, some heritage or nationality or someone's sexual preferences. Keep it cool daddio.

All that being said we can't stop how you talk to people via voice but one can report being uncomfortable if you do.
