# Dos & Donuts
Just plain good advice.

## Dos
* Wait for the 75% or at least the 50% discounts on plat purchases before thinking about buying plat.
* Only use your starter plat (150) on Warframe and/or weapon slots
* You'll have access to a lot to start. For instance Open World areas.
	- Just finish the starchart
	- The open world is going to wreck you.
* Do mark rare items for everyone to see. For example:
	- Argon Chrystals
	- Tellurium
* Have curtesy and wait for any remaining tenno to get to 10 radiant before extracting even if they take awhile
	- Just leave the squad after if it was a hassle.

## Donuts
* Be a fucking troll
	- Unless you're with the clan and you've made friends
* Make everyone wait at extracting
* Be in a sqad and say "BRB" and then be gone for more than 2 min.
* Bring slow Nova to a defense.
* Start an elevator unless every squad member is on it.
	- unless the remaining players are very far away
* Kill off all the enemeies in a void fissure until everyone's at 10
