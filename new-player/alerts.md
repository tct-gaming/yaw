# Alerts, Invasions & Nightwave
1. Check your alerts once a week.
2. Always do the invasions.

So, I've said that the star chart should be your #1 priority and while this is still true you should still do invasions & alerts if you can. 

There are 5 resources you can't get anywhere else [reasonably] effectively that you'll need to build dojo items.

1. `Mutagen Mass`
1. `Fieldron`
1. `Detonite Injector`
1. `Nitian Extract`
1. `Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates`

These are seriously a bear to get or build. For instance, for the first three, you buy a blueprint and it's one use. The ingredients for each blueprint can be a hassle to get. For instance `Mutagen Mass` requires `Mutagen Samples`. To get that you'll need to spend an hour or so in the derelict with 2 boosters, a smeeta and a nekros to be decently effective. And even then you'll get, if you're lucky, 200. Then to build you need multiple blueprints and 24 hours each.

Just do the invasions.

`Mutalist Alad V Nav Coordinates` are the WORST to get so just do the invasion as soon as you see them. You'll thank me later. (and you'll want, say, 15 at minimum before you try to go get mesa just in case).

For `Nitian Extract` you get this from nightwave. You should make `Nitian Extract` and `Vauban` component blueprints your priority when using Nightwave credits.
